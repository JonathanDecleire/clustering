## Context
Name of the project: Chipotle clustering challenge
Context of the project: BeCode, Li√®ge Campus, AI/Data Operator Bootcamp, February 2021
Objective of the project: 
- be able to use geopandas, matplotlib (and seaborn) to visualize clustered data onto a map.
- be able to determine appropriate clustering methods and variables to cluster.
- be able to allot the right amount of time for the tasks and present the results onto a readable GitHub page.


### Description
In this project we create a Python script to run, test and improve our cluster model.

Clustering is useful for exploring data. If there are many cases and no obvious groupings, clustering algorithms can be used to find natural groupings. Clustering can also serve as a useful data-preprocessing step to identify homogeneous groups on which to build supervised models.,..


### Usage
You can run the corresponding notebook to tune the hyperparameters and measure and the perfomances of our model.
Otherwise, you have only to run the main.ipynb file which computes and displays evrythink.

### Steps
- Plot the US map
 - Visualize our data on this map.
 - Plot a dendogram of our data to help us decide the appropropriate clustering resolution.
 - Compare and analyse different clustering methods using intrinsic analysis to decide on a chosen method.
 - Choose a centroid/adress to live.
### Libraries and environment
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install sklearn
pip install pandas
