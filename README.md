## Why clustering :
Clustering is useful for exploring data. If there are many cases and no obvious groupings, clustering algorithms can be used to find natural groupings. Clustering can also serve as a useful data-preprocessing step to identify homogeneous groups on which to build supervised models.

## When
Normally, this stuff should realized during one day.


## Usage
To begin your mission, you will need:\
python3 (or python)


Certain library:
- sklearn
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- geopandas
- seaborn

you will find plus information about geopy [here](https://pypi.org/project/geopy/) .

## How
Steps :
- Plot the US map
 - Visualize our data on this map.
 - Plot a dendogram of our data to help us decide the appropropriate clustering resolution.
 - Compare and analyse different clustering methods using intrinsic analysis to decide on a chosen method.
 - Choose a centroid/adress to live.

 ## notice
 The data used directly because after analyse we found that has no missed or error value.\
You will need to install certain libraries:

```bash
pip install sklearn
pip install pandas
pip install matplotlib
pip install geapandas
pip install numpy
pip install seaborn

```
if Python3 use pip3
